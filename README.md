Benchmarking for python packages 


## Python time-series benchmarking


* [Time-Series Elo ratings](https://microprediction.github.io/timeseries-elo-ratings/html_leaderboards/overall.html) considers methods for autonomous univariate prediction of relatively short sequences (400 lags) and ranks performance on predictions from 1 to 34 steps ahead. 







## R Time-series benchmarking software

* [ForecastBenchmark](https://github.com/DescartesResearch/ForecastBenchmark) automatically evaluates and ranks forecasting methods based on their performance in a diverse set of evaluation scenarios. The benchmark comprises four different use cases, each covering 100 heterogeneous time series taken from different domains.
